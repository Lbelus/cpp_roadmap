Incorporating Linux utilities into your C++ roadmap projects will give you practical experience with both C++ and Linux system programming. Here are the projects tied to Linux utilities:

### 1. **Static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast**
   - **Project:** Create a custom Linux `ls` command implementation that lists files in a directory. Use different cast types when processing file attributes, like determining if an entry is a file or directory.

### 2. **Difference between C cast and static_cast**
   - **Project:** Implement a simple version of the `df` utility in C++, which reports disk space usage. Use C-style casts and `static_cast` for type conversions when working with system calls and compare the safety and clarity.

### 3. **How to remove constness?**
   - **Project:** Write a configuration file editor for a Linux service (like `/etc/fstab`). Use a const structure to load the file and temporarily remove constness to allow modifications under certain conditions.

### 4. **Difference between pointers and reference**
   - **Project:** Create a C++ utility that mimics the behavior of the `ln` command (creating symbolic and hard links). Explore how pointers and references can be used to manage the linked files and directories.

### 5. **What type to use to represent a size**
   - **Project:** Develop a custom version of the `du` command, which computes the size of directories. Choose the appropriate type to represent the file sizes and handle edge cases like large files.

### 6. **Lifetime of a static variable**
   - **Project:** Implement a logging daemon that writes logs to a file. Use static variables to maintain the state of the log file and explore how the lifetime of these variables affects the program.

### 7. **How to pass an object/variable to a function?**
   - **Project:** Create a C++ version of the `ps` command that lists running processes. Experiment with different ways of passing process information (by value, reference, pointer) to various functions for filtering and formatting.

### 8. **Rvalue reference vs universal reference**
   - **Project:** Implement a command-line utility that processes large text files (similar to `grep`). Use rvalue references and universal references to efficiently handle file data and manage resources.

### 9. **When/how does C++ allocate on the heap/stack?**
   - **Project:** Develop a Linux utility that monitors system memory usage, similar to `top`. Track how your program allocates memory on the heap and stack, and optimize for different use cases.

### 10. **What is RAII, why use it?**
    - **Project:** Create a C++ wrapper for file handling (like opening, reading, and writing to files) that ensures files are properly closed using RAII. Integrate this into a simple utility like `cat` or `head`.

### 11. **What is polymorphism? How to achieve static polymorphism?**
    - **Project:** Design a pluggable C++ command-line utility framework where different modules (like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`) can be added or removed. Implement both dynamic and static polymorphism for managing these modules.

### 12. **How is dynamic polymorphism implemented in C++?**
    - **Project:** Write a C++ version of the `ls` command with plugins for different file formats (like `zip`, `tar`). Use dynamic polymorphism to handle the different formats and explore the underlying implementation.

### 13. **Multiple inheritance, why bad?**
    - **Project:** Implement a file manager utility that combines functionality from different Linux commands (like `cp`, `mv`, `rm`) using multiple inheritance. Identify and resolve issues like the diamond problem.

### 14. **When should a virtual class have a virtual destructor?**
    - **Project:** Create a command-line utility that processes different file types (like images, text, binaries). Ensure that derived classes for different file types have proper destructors, and test what happens when a base class lacks a virtual destructor.

### 15. **What is a static method?**
    - **Project:** Implement a utility similar to `find` that searches for files in a directory tree. Use static methods to provide common file handling functions, and compare their use with instance methods.

### 16. **How to make an object non-copyable?**
    - **Project:** Write a C++ utility that handles system-wide resources, like locking a file or managing a network socket. Make the resource manager class non-copyable to prevent resource conflicts.

### 17. **Shallow copy? What is move operator?**
    - **Project:** Create a utility that copies large files (like `cp`). Implement both shallow and deep copy mechanisms, and introduce move semantics to optimize performance for large data transfers.

### 18. **Difference between a map and an unordered_map**
    - **Project:** Implement a custom version of the `env` command, which prints environment variables. Use both `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` to manage the environment variables and compare their performance.

### 19. **How to printf a std::string**
    - **Project:** Write a C++ utility that formats and prints system logs (similar to `dmesg`). Implement a function to format `std::string` using `printf` style and integrate it into the log processing.

### 20. **What is using? Why use it over #define**
    - **Project:** Recreate the `alias` command in C++, allowing users to define and use shortcuts for other commands. Use `using` declarations to manage command aliases instead of `#define`.

### 21. **What are smart pointers?**
    - **Project:** Build a C++ utility that manages temporary files in a directory, like `/tmp`. Use `shared_ptr`, `unique_ptr`, and `weak_ptr` to manage file handles and ensure proper cleanup.

### 22. **Difference between static and dynamic libraries**
    - **Project:** Develop a C++ command-line tool that can load plugins dynamically at runtime (like `dlopen` in Linux). Compare the use of static and dynamic libraries for extending the tool's functionality.

### 23. **Why a virtual function should not be a template?**
    - **Project:** Attempt to design a C++ library for processing different file formats (e.g., `txt`, `csv`, `json`) using virtual functions and templates. Document the challenges and explore alternative designs that work around the limitations.

### 24. **Can we call main recursively?**
    - **Project:** Create a recursive file search utility (similar to `find`). Experiment with calling `main` recursively to process nested directories, and investigate the behavior and limitations.

### 25. **How exceptions work internally?**
    - **Project:** Implement a custom `grep` command that throws exceptions for different error conditions (like file not found). Explore how exceptions are propagated and handled, and analyze the stack unwinding process.

### 26. **Recode malloc, multi-threading producer-consumer, lock-free/wait-free**
    - **Project:** Re-implement the Linux `malloc` using custom memory pools. Then create a multi-threaded producer-consumer model that simulates a simple task manager. Finally, explore lock-free or wait-free algorithms for optimizing task management.

### 27. **Questions on GPU**
    - **Project:** Develop a C++ utility that processes large datasets (like an image processing tool). Offload parts of the computation to the GPU using CUDA or OpenCL and compare the performance with CPU-based processing.

### 28. **Write an efficient parallel_for**
    - **Project:** Implement a parallel version of the `sort` command in C++. Use a `parallel_for` loop to sort large files or datasets, and optimize the code for performance across multiple cores.

These projects not only reinforce the C++ concepts from your roadmap but also help you build practical tools that mimic real-world Linux utilities. Let me know which project you'd like to start with or if you need any additional guidance!
